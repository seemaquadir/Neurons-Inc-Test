Please find my response for the below questions.

What is the most important job of a QA engineer in a product team?

At first I would like to describe what are the main feautures needed for the product team.The product team is responsible for implementing strategy, building the roadmap, and defining product features. These are the people who choose what gets built, and measure performance â€”,crucial organizational roles within any company.
As a QA one should know the main purpose, main business of the product like what are we manufacturing, why are we doing, how are we doing. Then we can understand the requirement of it. We need to understand the business and make sure it is on company's quality standards. A thorough funcanility testing, regression testing, smoke ,sanity testing. Everything should be covered so that there are no misses of new/enhanced feature issues. Reviewing the specifications provided by the business and validating with the existing component present is also an important task for the QA. What is expected by business and what is there in the system!.
There is always a cycle which is every QA important job. Requriment Analysis -> Test case design -> Test Case Review -> Test Data preparation -> Test Execution -> Defect/Bug Raising -> Follow up on each process-> Test Documentation of test results, Bugs,Enhancements -> Test Results review -> A professional presentation to business on asked.
QA is the major step in every business, as the QA team is the one which approves whether the prodcut is working fine or not. SO being QA we should always make sure we donot miss anything.

What would the stack look like if you should design a QA environment from scratch today?
