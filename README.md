# Neurons-Inc-Test

****Neurons QA Engineering Posman API Test.**


Attached description and doumentation under the projects and also created an Issue documentation for the round off in the process, if there are any issues, on how can we use them.

Please find my response for the below questions.

What is the most important job of a QA engineer in a product team?

At first I would like to describe what are the main feautures needed for the product team.The product team is responsible for implementing strategy, building the roadmap, and defining product features. These are the people who choose what gets built, and measure performance —,crucial organizational roles within any company.
As a QA one should know the main purpose, main business of the product like what are we manufacturing, why are we doing, how are we doing. Then we can understand the requirement of it. We need to understand the business and make sure it is on company's quality standards. A thorough funcanility testing, regression testing, smoke ,sanity testing. Everything should be covered so that there are no misses of new/enhanced feature issues. Reviewing the specifications provided by the business and validating with the existing component present is also an important task for the QA. What is expected by business and what is there in the system!.
There is always a cycle which is every QA important job. Requriment Analysis -> Test case design -> Test Case Review -> Test Data preparation -> Test Execution -> Defect/Bug Raising -> tracking up on each process using tool will be more easy to track-> Update the status of test/Bug when every it moves a step a head-> Test Documentation of test results, Bugs,Enhancements -> Test Results review -> A professional presentation to business on asked.
QA is the major step in every business, as the QA team is the one which approves whether the prodcut is working fine or not. SO being QA we should always make sure we donot miss anything.

What are the main KPIs for a QA engineer?

KPIs - Key performance Indicator, the name itself says about key performance checks which QA need to perform.

Requirements of the Business
--------------------------------
We’ll keep track of the percentage of requirements that are met by at least one test. The efficacy of a requirement is determined by whether or not a test exists to demonstrate that it performs. The same can be said for a test that is part of your test schedule. The reliability of the test is determined by whether it was created to validate a requirement. Why do you need the test if it can’t be traced back to a requirement? As a Tester, you can keep an eye on this KPI every day and challenge the importance of rejected requirements and tests. You can optimize the testing process by determining how many test cases are being allotted to a requirement.

Execution of Test Instances
-----------------------------
This KPI just refers to the speed at which your test execution schedule is carried out. It tells you how many tests are executed in total and what is the daily/weekly run rate of test execution. 

Tests that are automated
----------------------------
There are different perspectives on what to automate vs. what not to automate, as well as the costs of managing the automation of system test cases. But the more automated testing you do, the more likely you are to catch crucial bugs incorporated into your software development pipeline. We can start small with this KPI and gradually increasing it as the QA team grows. Setting a goal of automating a percentage of test casess. Increase or decrease depending upon the size of your team, resources, time, and other quantifiable factors.

Active Defects:
---------------
As QA the main responsibilty will be the digging out bug, so always tracking active defects is a pretty simple KPI that you should be monitoring regardless.
Every software IT project comes with its share of defects. Depeding on the complexity of the project, the defect may also vary from minor to critical,and the status of the bug, KPI could mean the status is either new, open, or fixed (and waiting for re-test). Basically, if the defect is getting “worked”, then it’s active.

Defects fixed per day
----------------------
The Defects Fixed Per Day KPI ensures that your development team is hitting the “standard” when it comes to turning around fixes and keeping the build moving forward.

Passed Requirement
-------------------
Measuring your passed requirements is an effective method of taking the pulse on a given testing cycle. It is also a good measure to consider during a Go/No-Go meeting for a large release.

What would the stack look like if you should design a QA environment from scratch today?

How would you involve the QA Framework in the product team, from design to engineering?
